  <h2>Hsin Hsin Ming - Verses of the Faith Mind</h2>
  <h3>by Sengtsan
    Third Zen Patriarch of China (d. 606 AD)</h3>
<p>The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences When love and hate are both absent 
    everything becomes clear and undisguised Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. 
    If you wish to see the truth then hold no opinions for or against anything. To set up what you like against what you dislike 
    is the disease of the mind. When the deep meaning of things are not understood the mind’s essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
</p>

<p>The Way is perfect like vast space where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess. Indeed, it is due to our 
    choosing to accept or reject that we do not see the true nature of things. Live neither in the entanglement of 
    outer things, nor in inner feelings of emptiness. Be serene in the oneness of things and such erroneous views will 
    disappear by themselves. When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity your very effort fills you with activity. 
    As long as you remain in one extreme or the other you will never know Oneness.</p>

<p>Those who do not live in the single Way fail in both activity and passivity, assertion and denial. To deny the 
    reality of things is to miss their reality; to assert the emptiness of things is to miss their reality. The more 
    you talk and think about it, the further astray you wander from the truth. Stop talking and thinking, and there is 
    nothing you will not be able to know.</p> 

<p>To return to the root is to find the meaning, but to pursue appearances is to miss the source. At the moment of 
    inner enlightenment there is going beyond appearance and emptiness. The changes that appear to occur in the 
    empty world we call real only because of our ignorance. Do not search for the truth; only cease to cherish opinions.</p>

<p>Do not remain in the dualistic state; avoid such pursuits carefully. If there is even a trace of this and that, 
    of right and wrong, the Mind essence will be lost in confusion. Although all dualities come from the One, 
    do not be attached even to this One. When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way, nothing in the world can offend, 
    and when a thing can no longer offend, it ceases to exist in the old way.</p>
  
<p>When no discriminating thoughts arise, the old mind ceases to exist. When thought objects vanish, 
    the thinking subject vanishes, as when the mind vanishes, objects vanish. Things are objects because 
    of the subject (mind); the mind (subject) is such because of things (objects). Understand the relativity 
    of these two and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness. In the Emptiness the two are indistinguishable 
    and each contain in itself the whole world. If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine you will not be 
    tempted to prejudice and opinion.</p>


    <p>To live in the great Way is neither easy nor difficult, but those with limited views are fearful and irresolute; 
        the faster they hurry, the slower they go, and clinging (attachment) cannot be limited; even to be attached to 
        the idea of enlightenment is to go astray. Just let things be in their own way, and there will be neither 
        coming nor going. Obey the nature of things (your own nature). and you will walk freely and undisturbed.</p>

    <p>When thought is in bondage the truth is hidden, for everything is murky and unclear, and the burdensome practice 
        of judging brings annoyance and weariness. What benefit can be derived from distinctions and separations?
    </p>

    <p>If you wish to move in the one Way do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas. Indeed to accept them 
        fully is identical with true Enlightenment. The wise man strives to no goals but the foolish man fetters 
        himself. There is one Dharma, not many; distinctions arise from the clinging needs of the ignorant. To 
        seek Mind with the (discriminating) mind is the greatest of all mistakes.</p>

    <p>Rest and unrest derive from illusion; with enlightenment there is no liking and disliking. All dualities 
        come from ignorant inference. They are like dreams or flowers in air; foolish to try to grasp them. 
        Gain and loss, right and wrong; such thoughts must finally be abolished at once.</p>    


<p>If the eye never sleeps, all the dreams will naturally cease. If the mind makes no discriminations, the ten 
    thousand things are as they are, of single essence. To understand the mystery of this One essence is to be 
    released from all entanglements. When all things are seen equally the timeless Self essence is reached. 
    No comparisons or analogies are possible in this causeless, relationless state.</p>      
    
<p>Consider movement stationary and the stationary in motion, both movement and rest disappear. When such 
    dualities cease to exist Oneness itself cannot exist. To this ultimate finality no law or description applies.</p>  
    
<p>For the unified mind in accord with the Way all self-centered striving ceases. Doubts and irresolutions vanish and 
    life in true faith is possible. With a single stroke we are freed from bondage; nothing clings to us and we 
    hold on to nothing. All is empty, clear, self illuminating, with no exertion of the mind’s power. Here thought, 
    eeling, knowledge, and imagination are of no value. In this world of Suchness there is neither self nor other than self.
</p>


<p>To come directly into harmony with this reality just simply say when doubt arises, “Not two”. In this “not two” 
    nothing is separate, nothing is excluded. No matter when or where, enlightenment means entering this truth. 
    And this truth is beyond extension or diminution in time or space; in it a single thought is ten thousand years. 
    Emptiness here, Emptiness there, but the infinite universe stands always before your eyes. 
    Infinitely large and infinitely small: no difference, for definitions have vanished and no boundaries are seen. 
    So too with Being and non Being.</p>

<p>Don’t waste time in doubts and arguments that have nothing to do with this. One thing, all things: move and 
    intermingle, without distinction. To live in this realization is to be without anxiety about non perfection. 
    To live in this faith is the road to non duality. Because the non dual is one with the trusting mind.</p>


    <p>The Way is beyond language,<br />
        for in it there is<br />
        no yesterday<br />
        no tomorrow<br />
        no today.</p>
