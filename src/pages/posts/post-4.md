With Palms Together,
There are times I wish I weren’t a Zen priest. Today is such a time. I’ve been involved with Zen for around six decades. In that time, I have not known a period within which there has been no fighting within the ranks of teachers. This is a very, very sad situation indeed.

I can understand such within the ranks of students who have not received priesthood ordination; they are still within training. But fully ordained priests? What is up with that? Is it simply not possible to let our rumors, inuendo, and lineage judgements fall away?  Apparently not. I confess a couple decades ago, I myself got into it with the American Zen Teachers Association over their treatment of my Dharma grandfather Matsuoka Roshi. Petty, petty squabbles are irrelevant to the practice of Zen. I let that all fall away and focused my attention on my practice and that of my students.  I believe this is where our attention should focus and not on whether we believe some teacher is a quack, from a discredited lineage, or other such things.

                
                
At nearly eighty years old, I am certain Zen will survive and hopefully flourish. That is my hope anyway. If there is a test, let that test be in our practice and frankly, in my opinion, that is enough.

Daiho
