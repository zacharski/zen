With palms together,

This morning, like every morning, I sat outside in the chilled winter air watching the birds eat and drink.  The pigeons and mourning doves gather at the base of each feeder while the grackles and house finches pick at the tube feeders. An occasional thrasher joins the bunch.

We are to take care of the Earthâ€™s creatures, just as we are to take care of ourselves and our neighbors, friends and families.  I know it is difficult to do this at times, I sometimes struggle with it myself. Yet, it is the one thing we can do in times of chaos and upheaval. The Buddha Way is the way of compassion toward all those suffering or in need. While birdseed and water are cheap and easy to provide, food and shelter for homeless and immigrants are not cheap nor popular among many, if not most of the citizens of the United States due to the xenophobia and suspicion spread by those who fear either strangers or those who are different or less fortunate to themselves.

For the religious among us let us not forget the biblical teachings that would have us welcome the stranger. Both Jesus and Buddha worked with those different from themselves and those shunned in the societies they found themselves. Can we do anything less?

Be well and be a blessing

Daiho
