Recently I've taken to being far more reclusive than ever before. I'm no longer on Facebook or other social media, do not keep my device glued to my hip, and am generally not particularly responsive to inquiries. I have found this new position to be quite liberating, although somewhat frustrating as a writer. Writers need readers, you know?



Anyway, the Zen of it is this: practice is key, not an audience. One teaches through one's life, not one's written word. 



So, when the bell is invited to ring, sit. Or practice kinhin. Or practice oryoki. Or practice samu. 



There is nothing more.



Be well.
