With Palms Together,
Today is Tuesday. This morning, we practiced Zazen at 6:00 AM, and now we are having installed a battery system that runs off our solar panels. We will effectively be off the grid here in Las Cruces, NM.  I teach an Advanced Zen Buddhism class this evening.  Such is my day. 

My life as a Zen priest has been both rich and rewarding, as well as seriously challenging. Just because one is a priest does not mean one is not still a human being and as such, fraught with all the strengths and weakness associated with it. The thing about both the strengths and weaknesses is they are both teachers: both require humility gained from deep introspection.

When we approach our everyday lives, such as in my case just now, writing to you, I must be aware of myself, my message, you as reader, and so on. I must choose words you will know and ideas you might relate to. I might use words you don’t know, concepts perhaps alien to you, but with the desire to teach, perhaps awaken, and at bottom, communicate.

Of course, it is also on you to choose to read after the first few sentences, on you to relate, agree, disagree, challenge, and so on. I trust my skill, but also come to you with humility. Writing and reading are wondrous, ancient means of coming together as people and societies.

May your day be filled with wonder,

Daiho
