With palms together,

We each need to find our own ways to deal with the chaos arising in the United States. It is certainly challenging. I find myself in difficult conversations with friends over the changes being made here. Most of which violate not only my vales but also the values inherent in the Buddha Way.

We are to bring about abundant good for all beings, not just Americans. We are to be compassionate to all who are suffering, including ourselves. The Buddha accepted all peoples regardless of class into his sangha. Jesus, as well as the commandments in the Hebrew Scriptures, said we are to welcome the stranger and treat him as our kin. Yet now our government and its leaders oppose such values and in the guise of wanting to protect us want to do mass deportations, eliminate or reduce programs that help poor Americans, and stop communications from health agencies to the public.

I believe we should oppose such efforts. I believe we should make our voices now and that we should speak loudly and strongly for our core values, the values inherent in the Buddha Way. Silence is the enemy of democracy; it kills compassionate action and isolates us both within and outside the sangha.

May we each find our way.

Be well
