With palms together, 

This morning I am thinking about what obligations Zen Buddhists may have toward civil society. To be sure, the Third Pure Precept says we vow to bring about abundant good to all beings, yet what, today, does this actually mean? For me, one answer lay in the first paramita, generosity.

So often this is interpreted as financial generosity, yet I believe it is more about generosity of heart and spirit.

To practice this we must examine ourselves in the midst of the current chaos. It is far too easy to be angry, hateful and spiteful. Opening our hearts to those who hate us or promote policies we believe detrimental to society is a serious challenge. Yet, this is the Buddha Way.

May we each take a few minutes each day to practice allowing our hearts to blossom and bring comfort to all beings.
