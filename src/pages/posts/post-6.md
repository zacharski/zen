With palms together,

The morning air was brisk today as I sat outside just before dawn. Sitting outside, as the Buddha did, is a remarkable experience. Silence is thunder, the thunder of direct experience of the world around me.  There is the occasional sound of a car or truck in the distance, but nearby, sleeping households with just myself and the moon and stars. Not even the birds are awake.  Just me, myself and I coalescing together then at some point, falling away.

This falling away in hindsight seems magical because it is not conscious. There is no attempt to make it happen. Attention on my breath, yes, a release of my muscles of sorts yes, a feeling of joining, perhaps. Something like that.  In any event, the universe is there inseparable, complete, just as it is.

I suggest sitting outside in the open, practicing Zazen, and welcoming the dawn as it arises in the East.

Be well,

Daiho
