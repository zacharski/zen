With palms together,

When the world around us seems to be falling apart and threatening, rather than hiding we must stand upright in the face of it. Standing upright takes courage, it takes character, moral character. Which is to say, the character of our precepts, especially that found in the Four Bodhisattva Vows which we recite each day:

*Beings are numberless*, I vow to free them

*Delusions are inexhaustible*, I vow to end them

*Dharma gates are boundless*, I vow to enter them

*The buddha way is unsurpassable*, I vow to realize it.

There are no greater vows than these. They offer us a selfless way to address our world. When we take it upon ourselves to free others, to end our delusions, to enter the Dharma, and to realize our buddha nature, we are upright warriors facing the darkness that surrounds us. Why? Because we are the light in that darkness. Be that light.
